# powershell-auto-rsa-sha-signer
My first script with Powershell, in which I signed some certs with rsa-sha

## What is it

It is just my first script with Powershell, that I had to use in a Windows 10 VM that had not the wls for Linux.

## What does it

The script generates some files with a Base64-encoded rsa-sha signature, done with some RSA private keys, with some text inputs and with different rsa-sha bits (rs256, rs384, rs514).

The result is put in the "outputs" folder.

## Notes

Of course the keys I published on Github are used for important things :)
